# TODO 1: This class compares the user profile to the offers previously scraped and determines weather these are
#  valid offers (regarding the user CV) or not-valid ones.
#
# TODO 2: Valid ones are then sent to the web scraper to be filled and marked in the SQL database as valid ones to be
#  avoided in future runs (invalid ones are marked as such).
